# Fitness-Hub

The project aims to deliver the Fitness Hub web application, a
comprehensive solution to the fragmented communication and
management issues prevalent in the fitness industry. This includes a
fully functional web application with features catering to three
primary user groups: administrators, trainers/fitness centres, and
customers. For administrators, the application will provide
capabilities such as user management, content management, and bulk
messaging. Trainers and fitness centres will benefit from
functionalities like profile management, client interaction tools, and
program creation. Customers will have access to features enabling
them to discover trainers, view profiles, request sessions, and access
fitness programs. Additionally, the project will produce essential
documentation including user manuals, technical documents, and a
data repository. The desired outcomes include a centralized platform
for efficient communication, improved accessibility for customers.
